# Household Inventory – Java Spring API

[![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/merxgrc/household-inventory-java-spring-api/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/merxgrc/household-inventory-java-spring-api/actions/workflows/maven.yml)

This project is a **household inventory management system** designed to track items like food, cleaning supplies, and other materials. The goal is to provide a simple backend service that powers a web or mobile app for personal use.

Beyond personal use, this project demonstrates my ability to design and implement **enterprise-ready backend systems** using modern Java and Spring frameworks.

## Highlights
- Built with **Java 21 (LTS)** and **Spring Boot 3.5.5**
- Implements a **REST API** for managing inventory items. (CRUD operations, categories, stock thresholds)
- Designed for **scalability**, with PostgreSQL integration and a Next.js frontend planned.
- Demonstrates practical application of **Spring frameworks**. (Boot, Data JPA, Web, Validation)
- Developed with a **test-driven development (TDD) approach**, ensuring reliability and maintainability with JUnit 5.
- Structured with **cloud deployment in mind**. (AWS/GCP/Azure/OCI)
- Envisioned as part of a **full-stack solution**, with a Next.js frontend to complement the backend.

## Why This Project Matters
- Shows the ability to take a project from **idea → architecture → implementation**
- Demonstrates **backend engineering fundamentals**: REST APIs, persistence layer, data modeling, and API design.
- Reflects skills directly relevant to roles in **backend development, full-stack development, and cloud engineering**.
- Provides evidence of using **industry best practices** such as Test Driven Development and clean project structure.

## Next Steps (Roadmap)
- Add authentication and role-based access control with Spring Security
- Implement reporting endpoints (e.g., frequently restocked items)
- Build a Next.js frontend for full-stack integration
- Deploy to the cloud with CI/CD pipelines
